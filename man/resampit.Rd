\title{resampit: Simple bootstrapping of fish groups to generate CIs}
\usage{
resampit(assignmentFile = NULL, assignmentColumn = "groups",
  tagRates = NULL, bootstraps = 500, ci = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignmentFile}{The .csv file containing the group (e.g, PBT) assignments including those fish that could not
be assigned to a group.}

\item{assignmentColumn}{The name of the column in \code{assignmentFile} containing the group assignments. In the
case of PBT, this column should contain the hatchery and brood year (BY) combination for any assigned fish.
For example, OtsRAPH08 may represent a fish that assigns to Rapid River hatchery broodstock spawned in 2008.
Note that every group defined in this column MUST have a tagging rate defined in the \code{tagRates} file (see
below). Otherwise, an error will print (e.g., "OtsRAPH08 has no tagging rate defined") and assignments for that
group will NOT be expanded. Fish that did not assign to a group MUST contain "Unassigned" in this column.}

\item{tagRates}{The .csv file containing tagging rates for any group defined in the \code{assignmentColumn} column of
\code{assignmentFile}. The file should only contain 2 columns. The first column should contain group names that
MUST match the group names used in the \code{assignmentColumn} column of \code{assignmentFile}. Tagging rates must
be expressed as proportions.}

\item{bootstraps}{The number of bootstraps to be performed.}

\item{ci}{The confidence interval to be generated expreseed as a proportion (e.g., 0.90 or 0.95).}
}
\description{
resampit() is a function that re-samples (bootstraps) a table of group assignments (e.g., from PBT
GSI, PIT tags, etc.) and then expands those groups according to group-specific tag rates to generate
confidence intervals around group proportion estimates.
